# IAPR: ProjectÂ¶

### Description
Your task is to ready yourself for the final evaluation. The day of the exam we will give you a new folder with a new game. ! The digits on the cards differ from the one of the traning set. When given a new data folder with 13 images your should be able to:
#### Task 0
	- Plot an overlay for each round image that shows your detections and classification. You can for example plot bounding boxes around the cards/dealer token and add a text overlay with the name of the classes.
#### Task 1
	- Predict the rank of the card played by each player at each round (Standard rules).
	- Predict the number of points of each player according to Standard rules
#### Task 2
	- Detect which player is the selected dealer for each round.
	- Predict the rank and the suit of the card played by each player at each round (Advanced rules).
	- Predict the number of points of each player according to Advanced rules
